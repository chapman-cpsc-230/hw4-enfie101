## Description

_This assignment contained problems from the book which asked for us to implement functions then test those functions.  The assignment also had additional problems for creating histograms._

## What I Learned from This

_I learned how you can test functions and the beginnings steps to making different sorts of tables (on this assignment, they were histograms)._

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
